The app basically displays a list of events by different clubs and gymkhana.
The + button on the top will help in adding a new event.
The icon next to it will take you to the polling discussion.
Entire app is backed up by Firebase real-time database.

Things which can be added: 
1. Login for users.
2. Event addition only by club secy/ gen sec.
3. Poll to save user so that he cannot vote again on the same poll.
